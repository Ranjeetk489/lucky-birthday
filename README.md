# lucky birthday
 A website page which takes birthyear and lucky number. Then tells the user about their birthday being lucky or not. To find whether the provided birthdate is lucky or not, it checks the sum of the number of birthdate and divides it with lucky number. If the result remainder is zero then it prints out saying "birthday is lucky" else it's unlucky
